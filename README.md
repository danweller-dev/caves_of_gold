\## Overview



\*\*Caves of Gold\*\* is a simple, text-based Python adventure game designed

specifically for \*\*Key Stage 3 (KS3)\*\* learners. It introduces

fundamental programming concepts through an engaging scenario involving

exploration, traps, treasure, monsters, and turn-based combat.



The game was intentionally built \*\*without functions\*\*, following the

structure of typical KS3 Python schemes of work where functions have not

yet been introduced. This ensures the code remains readable, linear, and

accessible for early programmers.



\## Educational Purpose \& Background



This game was developed as a teaching tool to help KS3 learners

understand the core concepts of Python programming in a fun and

immersive way.



In classroom use, I found that \*\*even the simplest game scenario

dramatically increased student engagement, focus, and lesson

participation\*\*. Introducing a narrative --- no matter how basic ---

increases motivation and improves the ratio of active learners versus

passive learners.



The design of the game aligns directly with KS3 Computing learning

objectives, covering:



\-   Inputs and outputs\\

\-   Variables and assignments\\

\-   Arithmetic expressions\\

\-   Selection (`if`, `elif`, `else`)\\

\-   Iteration (`while` loops)\\

\-   Counters\\

\-   Boolean flags\\

\-   Randomness\\

\-   Managing program state\\

\-   Reading and understanding sequential code flow



\## Features



\-   Explore randomly generated cave events\\

\-   Fight 3 different monster types\\

\-   Discover random treasure\\

\-   Trigger traps with risk-adjusted damage\\

\-   Find or loot 3 weapons, 3 armour types, and 3 potions\\

\-   Use healing, power, and escape potions\\

\-   Rest with a chance of healing --- or being harmed\\

\-   Track HP, gold, battles won, potions held, and gear bonuses\\

\-   Permadeath (game ends at 0 HP)\\

\-   All stats displayed and updated each turn



\## Learning Objectives Covered (KS3)
